# README #

Please complete this README with as much installation notes as possible. We can forget API levels, sensor names/types and all other sorts of information and here looks like a good place to just leave them.

Issue section will be used to track down tasks and bugs so take a look there as well.

### Note on Tasks: ###

 * I think it is best practice to create a Task each time you want to do something and assign it to yourself (or others if applicable) so that by accident we don't end up doing the same thing at the same time. And then in the end we have a nice document of who did what in case they asked.
